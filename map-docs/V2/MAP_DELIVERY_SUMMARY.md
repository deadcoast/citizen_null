   ```

2. **From Filter Bar:**
   ```
   User searches location → Results filtered → Clicks map icon
   → Map shows all matching stations
   ```

3. **Standalone Map Page:**
   ```
   User navigates to /map route → Full map interface
   → Can explore all locations and click to view items
   ```

4. **From Map Back to Items:**
   ```
   User explores map → Clicks station → Sees item list
   → Clicks item → Opens ItemModal with full details
   ```

## Next Steps to Go Live

1. **Copy files to your project**
   ```
   src/components/StantonMap.jsx
   src/data/mapData.js
   ```

2. **Connect to your items database**
   - Import your items.json
   - Call `populateStationItems()`
   - Pass to map component

3. **Add to your routing**
   - Option A: New route at `/map`
   - Option B: Modal triggered from items
   - Option C: Both!

4. **Style adjustments**
   - Match your exact color palette
   - Adjust fonts if needed
   - Tweak spacing/sizing

5. **Test with real data**
   - Ensure station names match your items
   - Verify all locations show up
   - Test interactions

6. **Deploy**
   - Map is ready for production
   - No external dependencies beyond React
   - Works in all modern browsers

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Single System Only**
   - Currently only Stanton implemented
   - Pyro, Nyx, etc. require additional data

2. **No Mouse Pan/Drag**
   - Only button-based zoom
   - Future enhancement

3. **Static Station Positions**
   - Stations don't orbit (would be complex animation)
   - Acceptable for reference map

4. **Limited Mobile Optimization**
   - Works on mobile but better on desktop
   - Touch gestures not implemented

---

## Pro Tips

**For Best Results:**
- Use the map as a discovery tool (users explore then click items)
- Link item cards back to map ("View on Map" button)
- Consider adding map thumbnail previews in item modals
- Use map as your site's navigation hub
- Promote it as "Intel Network" or "Galaxy Database"

**For Your Aesthetic:**
- The map maintains your punk zine feel through the popups and typography
- The space view honors Star Citizen's universe
- It's the perfect blend: "salvaged datapad showing citizen intel"
