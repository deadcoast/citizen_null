## Overview

Citizen Zine combines the raw, authentic energy of 90s punk zines with Star Citizen's sci-fi universe to create an underground information network for players. Think photocopied intel sheets circulating through Crusader station back-alleys, hand-stamped "NEW LOOT" warnings, and that authentic distrust of polished corporate design.

## Design Philosophy

### "Authentic, Not Aesthetic"
This isn't a tribute to punk - it IS punk. Every design decision feels like it was made by someone with access to a photocopier, scissors, and glue in 1992.

### Core Principles
- **Information First, Beauty Second** - Players need FAST and CLEAR data
- **DIY or Die** - Nothing looks polished or professional
- **High Contrast** - Black, white, cream, and strategic red accents
- **Photocopied Texture** - Grain, artifacts, and imperfect alignment

### Visual Language
- **Typography**: Courier New (monospace) for headlines, Arial for body text
- **Colors**: 95% grayscale, 5% punk red accents
- **Textures**: Paper grain, photocopier artifacts, halftone dots
- **Layout**: Collage approach with overlapping elements and strategic white space

## Map System

### Interactive 3D Stanton System
- **4 Planets**: Hurston, Crusader, ArcCorp, microTech
- **12+ Stations**: Landing zones, orbital stations, Lagrange points
- **Item Pins**: Visual markers showing item availability
- **Orbit Visualization**: Accurate orbital mechanics display
- **Professional Controls**: Pan, zoom, rotate with smooth animations

### Map Features
- **Clickable Planets** - Expand to show stations
- **Station Details** - View available items and descriptions
- **Item Integration** - Click items to open detailed modals
- **Search & Filter** - Find specific locations quickly
- **Mobile Optimized** - Touch controls for mobile devices

## Usage

### For Players
1. **Browse Items** - Use the interactive map to explore locations
2. **Search & Filter** - Find specific items by name, rarity, or location
3. **View Details** - Click items for comprehensive information
4. **Plan Routes** - Use the map to plan your item collection runs

### For Developers
1. **Add Items** - Update `src/data/items.json` with new items
2. **Modify Map** - Edit `src/data/mapData.js` for map changes
3. **Customize Design** - Update Tailwind classes for visual changes
4. **Extend Features** - Add new components following the established patterns
