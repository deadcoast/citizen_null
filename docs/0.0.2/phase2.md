| Week 5-6 | Modal system, data integration | 20 hours |
| Week 7-8 | Custom map feature | 20 hours |
| Week 9 | Responsive design, polish, animations | 10 hours |
| Week 10 | Testing, bug fixes, deployment | 10 hours |
| Total | MVP Launch | ~100 hours |

With 2-3 Developers:

## 4. CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS

After 3 Months:
- 1,000+ unique visitors
- 50+ items in database
- <2 second page load time
- >80 Lighthouse score
- 30%+ return visitor rate

After 6 Months:
- 5,000+ unique visitors

## 5. RISK MITIGATION

Risk: Star Citizen patches change item data
- Mitigation: Version control item data by patch number

Risk: Site becomes outdated between patches
- Mitigation: Add "Last Updated" timestamp, auto-archive old patches

Risk: High traffic after patch release
- Mitigation: Use CDN, optimize bundle size, implement caching

Risk: Copyright issues with Star Citizen assets
- Mitigation: Fair use, fan site, link to official sources, don't monetize

## MULTI RPLATFORM OPTIMIZATION

### Mobile (< 640px)

Philosophy: "Pocket Zine"
- Think: folded up zine in back pocket
- Simpler layout, bigger touch targets
- Less collage, more linear
- Maintain DIY feel but prioritize clarity

Adaptations:
- Single column (no grid)
- Larger text (readability on small screen)
- Filter bar collapses to hamburger (with punk aesthetic)
- Cards stack vertically
- Bigger tap areas (minimum 44x44px)

### Tablet (640-1024px)

Philosophy: "Open Zine on Table"
- Two-column layout
- More white space
- Collage elements start appearing
- Side-by-side comparisons possible
