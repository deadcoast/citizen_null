## DESIGN

- 90'S Zine Aesthetic

## TARGET NICHE

The website will serve ongoing players most. Between patches, dedicated players dont want to read through thousands of words, click through 20 or 30 pages of website. Additionally, they dont watn to have to keep returning and searching for where they found the data in the first place.

- Citizen Zine aims to bridge this gap, providing users a seamless, aesthetic, and straight forward database on whats new, where to find it, how to obtain it.

### PROBLEM

Currently, there is no where to find targeted data on whats new in the patch. Players need to sift through the [OFFICIAL STAR CITIZEN WEBSITE](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/) when patches go live, or read through the patch notes. The issue with both of these approaches, is there is expositional dumps, information overload. Its hard for players to isolate and find what items they need to look for, or where.

### SOLUTION

The website serves as a targeted resource that provides players with exactly what new rare things are in the patch, what they are, where to find them, how to obtain them.

## CUSTOM FEATURES

Simple 'star citizen' map to provide an aesthetic location of the asset:

- The map is not required to be advanced in nature, it just needs to be modular, look similar to star citizens map, and allows user to enter in the data required(planet names, event names, planet location names, etc.)
